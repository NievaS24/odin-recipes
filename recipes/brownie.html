    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This brookie recipe was inspired by a co-worker who couldn't decide if she wanted brownies or chocolate chip cookies for her birthday treat. Since she said I should just pick one, I thought this up on the way home. I couldn't find a recipe like it on Allrecipes, so I created it. These brookies go quickly; I usually make a double batch in a jelly roll pan.</p>

    </ol>
